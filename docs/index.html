  	<h2>Fibonacci sequence</h2>
  	Demonstrates the use of accumulators, and the difference between interpreted and uninterpreted arithmetic expressions.
  </section>
  <section>
  	This implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is very inefficient -- the 30th number takes about 90 seconds!

  <section>
  	Variant of <code>fib/2</code> that returns an uninterpreted arithmetic expression showing the computation tree.

  </section>
  <section>
	We can get an efficient version by solving a more general problem!
