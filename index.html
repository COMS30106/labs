  	<h2>Fibonacci sequence</h2>
  	Demonstrates the use of accumulators, and the difference between interpreted and uninterpreted arithmetic expressions.
  </section>
  <section>
  	This implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is very inefficient -- the 30th number takes about 90 seconds!
    {% include swish_box.html id="fib" %}
  </section>
  <section>
  	Variant of <code>fib/2</code> that returns an uninterpreted arithmetic expression showing the computation tree.
    {% include swish_box.html id="fibt" %}
  </section>
  <section>
	We can get an efficient version by solving a more general problem!
    {% include swish_box.html id="fibn" %}

  	<h2>Second-order predicates</h2>
  	generate all solutions to a query.

  	Sorting, quick and dirty
    {% include swish_box.html id="setof_sort" %}

			## Generate and test
			This is a programming technique exploiting Prolog's non-determinism:
			- a *generator* generates candidate solutions;
			- a *tester* checks whether a candidate has the required properties.
			
			It will be beneficial to make the generator as efficient as possible
